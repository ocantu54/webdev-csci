        <h1>The Chevrolet Corvette Z06</h1>
        <p><b>The Chevrolet Corvette Z06</b> is an exciting high-performance version of the C8 Corvette, designed to deliver track-focused performance without sacrificing road comfort. Take a look at some of its features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Engine: The Z06 includes a 5.5-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, capable of producing 670 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, making it the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 in a production car.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Transmission: The Z06 comes with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, providing rapid shifts and optimizing performance on both track and street.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Performance Features: The Z06 includes a front splitter, rear wing, and available Z07 Performance Package, which adds even more downforce for enhanced cornering ability. It also features Magnetic Ride Control 4.0, which adjusts damping in real-time, and carbon-ceramic brakes for better stopping power.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Handling: The Z06 has wider front and rear tracks and larger wheels and tires compared to the standard Corvette Stingray. This improves grip and handling at high speeds, complemented by Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires on the Z07 package for maximum traction.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Performance Figures: With its high-revving V8 and extensive aerodynamics, the Z06 can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 2.6 seconds, putting it in supercar territory.</li>
