    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
<p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<l1>2 eggs</l1>
<l2>1tbs butter</l2>
<l3>2tbs cream</l3>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</p>
<p>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</p>
<p>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</p>
<p>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</p>
<p>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</p>
